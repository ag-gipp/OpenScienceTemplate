# How to "abuse" OpenSource tools for OpenScience

Open science gets increasing attention recently [[1]].
For instance, the OpenAIRE project supports the European vision for open access and open data [[2]].
Rather than discussing the theory, political and ethical implications, this guide outlines, how you can do open science right now.
To do this we combine systems originating from the open source movement, the digital legal initiative, and first results of the open science movement itself.
In this 7 step guide, we describe how to collaboratively write a paper in LaTeX and obtain a DOI for that.
However, the same principle can be applied to plan a user study, run a computer experiment or develop a research prototype of a software.

## Step 1: Create a git repository

The first step is to create a git repository.
For GitHub navigate to

 http://github.com/new/
 
and chose a meaningful name.
I suggest following the naming convention Year (2 digits) Conference acronym (3-5 letters) Project name


_PS: If you want to start open science secretly, you might want to start with a private repository. Note, that GitHub provides free educational licenses [[3]]._

_PPS: We use the version control system git hosted on GitHub.com to manage our software, documentation, notes and the scientific text._

## Step 2: Register the trusted timestamping service
_PPS: From the legal domain, we use the trusted timestamping service opriginstamp.org to ensure the integrity of our data, software and to prove it's originality._
## Step 3: Register the continuous integration service

_PPS: We use travis to test our software run scientific experiments to compile our scientific texts._

## Step 3: Write your paper

## Step 4: Make your preprint public

## Step 5: Register the publication service

## Step 6: Release a version and get a DOI

## Step 7: Create a git repository
